            <br>《情如浪濤剪不斷》 《霍東閣》（霍元甲系列第三部）的一首舒情插曲。又名：柳葉船。
            <br>演唱：徐小明
            <br>
            <br>半生漂泊遇到你是緣， 刻骨銘心相愛亦溫暖。
            <br>未怕霜雪飄，何愁暴風雨，情如浪浮破木船。
            <br>冷風淒雨露打柳葉船，刀光劍影波折萬千寸。
            <br>莫嘆生太短，柔情未改變。船乘浪潮輕駛遠。
            <br>共尋覓，歡笑片斷，茫茫蒼海似靜還亂。
            <br>牽你手，傳我曖，撐舵在風波內轉。
            <br>兩心相印樂比世外園，冰峰雪飄心裡亦溫暖。
            <br>共你相眷戀，閒愁盡飛遠。情如浪濤剪不斷。
            <br>
            <br>A comfortable episode in the love of the love is like a wave of love. Also known as: Liuye Boat.
            <br>Sing: Xu Xiaoming
            <br>
            <br>It is our destiny When I meet you after a half-life wandering, Our passionate love keep each other warm.
            <br>I am not afraid of frost and snow,  nor storm and rain, love is like a breaking wooden boat on the wave.
            <br>The cold wind and rain dew hit the willow boat, and the sword light sword shadow waves were tens of inches.
            <br>Don't sigh that life is too short,  but our tenderness has not changed. The boat on the wave drove away lightly.
            <br>Looking together for our happy moments, and the vast sea seemed to be quiet and chaotic.
            <br>Hold your hand, pass you my warmth, and control the rudder in the storm.
            <br>The two hearts joininng together are happier than in the world's paradise.
            <br>Being so attached to each other, our sorrows have flown away. Love is like a continuous flowing of waves.
